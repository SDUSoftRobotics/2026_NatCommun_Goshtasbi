This repository contains the MATLAB code and experimental data accompanying the article:
“Tactile Perception through Fluid–Solid Interaction.”

**Raw Data Processing**

The Raw Data Processing folder includes MATLAB scripts used to process the experimental data, converting collected signals into pressure and force measurements.
Example datasets are provided for:

- 1D sensor diameter of 1.5 mm for all 3 media

- 2D sensor

- Underwater 1D sensor

**Machine Learning**

The Learning folder contains MATLAB code for fuzzy clustering, used to train and analyze the dataset.
Example data includes:

- 1D sensor all data

- 2D 60×60 sensor

These datasets correspond to those used in the paper.

**MATLAB-Python TCP**

This folder includes MATLAB and Python code for establishing a TCP/IP connection between MATLAB and Python.
It is used to connect the trained ANFIS model in MATLAB with Python to interface and control the UR robot during the HRI demonstrations.

**FSI COMSOL Simulation** 

This section contains files and instructions related to the Fluid–Solid Interaction (FSI) simulation performed in COMSOL Multiphysics.
A detailed description and simulation data can be found at the following [link](https://github.com/mwberghuis/softsensor?tab=readme-ov-file)
